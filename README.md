## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Job-Portal-Pro.git](https://github.com/your-username/Job-Portal-Pro.git)
    cd Job-Portal-Pro
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables.

    ```env
    # MongoDB Connection URI
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # NextAuth.js Configuration
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=a_long_random_string_for_nextauth_secret
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

    # Google Provider (Optional)
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

    # GitHub Provider (Optional)
    GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
    GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret

    # Base URL for API calls
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

    - Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB URI.
    - Generate a secure string for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. You can use an online tool or a command like `openssl rand -base64 32`.
    - You can add other providers like Google or GitHub by getting the credentials from their developer consoles.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

5.  **Open the application:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
